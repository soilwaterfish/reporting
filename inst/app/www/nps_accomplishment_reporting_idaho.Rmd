# USDA Forest Service - Idaho Units 
# FY`r params$fiscal_year` Accomplishment Highlights

## Introduction  

The latest iteration of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) in Idaho and the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (MT DEQ) was signed in early 2020 as a five-year update to the longstanding MOU. Section IV (E) of the MOU states:  

|                   IV. The Forest Service and BLM shall:  

	    
|                             E. As requested, provide IDEQ water quality/Best Management Practice monitoring 
|                             plans, results of BMP effectiveness determinations and any other information necessary 
|                             to meet the intent of Idaho’s Water Quality Management Program and Antidegradation 
|                             Policy.
            

For `r params$fiscal_year`, geospatial data has been shared with IDEQ representing locations where selected watershed restoration activities have occurred on USFS-managed lands.  

This `r params$fiscal_year` provides a statewide snapshot of accomplishments in four reporting categories: soil and watershed acres improved; stream miles improved/linear feature restoration activities; Best Management Practices monitoring; and priority watersheds improved. Annual accomplishment reports from individual forests can be forwarded to IDEQ where available.  

The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) created multiple new programs for funding watershed and aquatic restoration activities on NFS lands. Idaho National Forests has been the beneficiary of these programs, in particular the Legacy Roads and Trails program, the Collaborative, Aquatic-Focused Landscape Restoration (CALR) program, and the IRA Source Water Protection Program. Forests are actively working on implementation of projects associated with these programs and have a variety of outyear BIL and/or IRA-funded projects already approved. More information on BIL- and IRA-related funding accomplishments will be provided to IDEQ during coordination meetings and in subsequent years’ reports.   

Data included in this FY`r params$fiscal_year` annual report have been drawn from the Forest Service’s national accomplishment reporting databases. Reported watershed restoration activities have been filtered to showcase accomplishments most pertinent to attainment and improvement of water resource beneficial uses. While national and regional reporting guidance is provided, individual Forests retain some discretion as to which activities they elect to report subject to the needs of their programs. More restoration and mitigation activities may have been completed by some Forests than reported here.   

Though efforts have been made to ensure equitable accounting of accomplishments, not every acre reported can be assumed to have the same level of landscape benefit or effect. As noted above, accomplishment reports from individual National Forests can further contextualize the scope of work completed.  

## Soil and Water Acres Improved  

Figure 1 shows selected soil, water, and aquatic habitat project activities accounted for as acres improved on USFS managed lands in Idaho. USFS Idaho Forests performed a variety of activities in service of watershed restoration across seven general categories (Figure 1.).  

Idaho National Forests completed approximately `r poly_act_summary_groups %>% pull(sum_of_treatment) %>% sum() %>% round() %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` acres of soil, water, and aquatic habitat improvement activities in `r params$fiscal_year`. Highlights of this work included `r poly_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_poly_rank) %>% pull(sum_of_treatment) %>%  round() %>% prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` acres of `r poly_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_poly_rank) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  tolower() %>% prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)`, accounting for `r poly_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_poly_rank) %>% pull(acres_pct) %>% round() %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` percent of all acres improved. Other notable project activities included `r poly_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_poly_rank-1) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  tolower() %>% prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)`, `r poly_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_poly_rank-2) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  tolower() %>% prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)`, and `r poly_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_poly_rank-3) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  tolower() %>% prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)`. Multiple forests completed fish or aquatic habitat connectivity treatment, road or trail decommissioning, road or trail repair, maintenance, or impact reduction in Fiscal Year 2023.  

## Stream Miles Improved/Linear Feature Restoration Activities  

Figure 2 provides a statewide snapshot of stream miles improved through various restoration activities. As an illustrative example, total miles of road decommissioned should be interpreted as miles of stream habitat benefiting from road decommissioning, not the total mileage of roads decommissioned.  


`r line_act_summary_groups %>% pull(sum_of_treatment) %>% sum() %>% round() %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` miles of streams were maintained or improved across Idaho National Forests in FY2023. `r line_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_line_rank) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` contributed to nearly `r line_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_line_rank) %>% pull(sum_of_treatment) %>% round() %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` miles of stream habitat improvement across the state, followed by `r line_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_line_rank-1) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` and `r line_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_line_rank-2) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)`. Rounding out the stream miles improved portfolio, approximately `r line_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_line_rank-3) %>% pull(sum_of_treatment) %>% round() %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)`  miles of `r line_act_summary_groups %>% filter(rank == max_line_rank-3) %>% pull(activity_type_category) %>%  prettyNum(big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE)` were completed.

## Best Management Practice (BMP) Monitoring  

The Forest Service’s National Core Best Management Practice (BMP) program was initiated in 2012 with the intent of improving water quality management through consistent and effective application of BMPs associated with management activities conducted on NFS lands. In doing so, this program provides important tools to help ensure Forest Service management activities comply with the Clean Water Act. Prior to development of the national program, BMP planning and implementation was directed by overlapping state-specific guidance and individual forest and regional policies and protocols. The National Core BMP program provides a standardized set of core BMPs for avoiding or mitigating effects to soil and water resources associated the range of management activities. In addition to the core BMPs, it provides a series of systematic monitoring protocols for virtually all management activities conducted on NFS lands (USDA Forest Service 2012).   

Per Idaho DEQ’s request for a five-year compendium of National Core BMP reviews, a standalone report has been developed; see that report for further details.  

## Priority Watershed Conditions Improved  

The Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) is the Forest Service’s nationally consistent approach to classifying and tracking watershed condition, identifying priority work locations, and carrying out essential project activities in effort to improve or maintain watershed conditions across NFS-managed lands (Potyondy and Geier 2011). The Forest Service’s publicly accessible online Watershed Classification Interactive Map Viewer can be found at the following link: https://usfs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=f4332e5b80c44874952b57e1db0b4407.  

Priority subwatershed (i.e. HUC12) designation is accompanied by development of a Watershed Restoration Action Plan (WRAP), which consists of a suite of designated “essential projects” designed to address restoration needs within the watershed. When all essential projects have been completed in an action plan, watershed condition is designated as improved in the database or record. Completion of all essential projects in a WRAP requires substantive funding and often takes many years to complete. Monitoring is conducted to evaluate longer-term efficacy of restoration efforts.  

The Northern Region did not complete any WRAPs in designated priority watersheds in FY2023. The region, including Montana National Forests, has been consistently completing one or two WRAPs every fiscal year for the last few years. As a result of a change in Washington Office direction regarding accomplishment reporting (i.e. report the date work is completed on the ground v. contracted date) and some permitting-related implementation delays, two priority watersheds anticipated for completion in FY2023 will not be counted as accomplished until FY2024. The Northern Region anticipates contributing to the national target over the next few years via completion of a series of WRAPs funded with BIL and IRA funding. Essential project work across multiple units is ongoing or slated to be completed in Fiscal Year 2024. Additionally, multiple new priority watershed designations and associated WRAPs are anticipated for FY2024.  

The Intermountain Region completed XX WRAPs in 2023….
